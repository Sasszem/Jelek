# Linear resistive networks analyzer

This project is a simple analyzer for linear resistive networks. The project has two parts: a network solver and a (still in drafting phase, possibly forever) visual network editor. This page only documents the analyzer for now.

The newest version of this project is available at the [Github repo](https://github.com/Sasszem/Jelek), and the documentation at the [github.io page](https://sasszem.github.io/Jelek/)
